Q001(Easy): Two Sum
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.
Example:
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].


Q002(Medium): Add Two Numbers
You are given two linked lists representing two non-negative numbers. 
The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. 
Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.
Example:
Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8


Q003(Medium): Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
Example:
Given "abcabcbb", the answer is "abc", which the length is 3.
Given "bbbbb", the answer is "b", with the length of 1.
Given "pwwkew", the answer is "wke", with the length of 3. 
Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.


Q004(Hard): Median of Two Sorted Arrays
There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively.
Find the median of the two sorted arrays. 
The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)). 
Example1:
nums1 = [1, 3]
nums2 = [2]
The median is 2.0
Example2:
nums1 = [1, 2]
nums2 = [3, 4]
The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5

Q005(Medium): Longest Palindromic Substring
Given a string S, find the longest palindromic substring in S. 
You may assume that the maximum length of S is 1000, and there exists one unique longest palindromic substring.
Example:
"cabccba", the longest palindromic substring is "abccba".

Q006(Easy): ZigZag Conversion
The string "PAYPALISHIRING" is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows like this: 
(you may want to display this pattern in a fixed font for better legibility)
P   A   H   N
A P L S I I G
Y   I   R
And then read line by line: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"
Write the code that will take a string and make this conversion given a number of rows:
string convert(string text, int nRows);
Example1:
convert("PAYPALISHIRING", 3) should return "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR".
Example2:
a       i       q       y
b     h j     p r     x z
c   g   k   o   s   w
d f     l n     t v
e       m       u
return "aiqybhjprxzcgkoswdflntvemu"
Example3:
a     g    m     s     y
b   f h  l n   r t   x z
c e   i k  o q   u w
d     j    p     v
return "agmsybfhlnrtxzceikoquwdjpv"

Q007(Easy): Reverse Integer
Reverse digits of an integer.
Example1:
x = 123, return 321
Example2:
x = -123, return -321
