Q011(Medium): Container With Most Water
Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an, where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). 
n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). 
Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.
Note: You may not slant the container.

Q015(Medium): 3Sum
Given an array S of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in S such that a + b + c = 0?
 Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.
Note: The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.
For example, given array S = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4],
A solution set is:
[
  [-1, 0, 1],
  [-1, -1, 2]
]

Q016(Medium): 3Sum Closest
Given an array S of n integers, find three integers in S such that the sum is closest to a given number, target.
Return the sum of the three integers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.
For example, given array S = {-1 2 1 -4}, and target = 1.
The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
