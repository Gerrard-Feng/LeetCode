Q011(Medium): Container With Most Water
Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an, where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). 
n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). 
Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.
Note: You may not slant the container.

Q012(Medium): Integer to Roman
Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral.
Input is guaranteed to be within the range from 1 to 3999.

Q013(Easy): Roman to Integer
Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.
Input is guaranteed to be within the range from 1 to 3999.

Q014(Easy): Longest Common Prefix
Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

Q015(Medium): 3Sum
Given an array S of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in S such that a + b + c = 0?
 Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.
Note: The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.
For example, given array S = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4],
A solution set is:
[
  [-1, 0, 1],
  [-1, -1, 2]
]

Q016(Medium): 3Sum Closest
Given an array S of n integers, find three integers in S such that the sum is closest to a given number, target.
Return the sum of the three integers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.
For example, given array S = {-1 2 1 -4}, and target = 1.
The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).

Q017(Medium): Letter Combinations of a Phone Number
Given a digit string, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent.
A mapping of digit to letters (just like on the telephone buttons) is given below.
Example:
Input:Digit string "23"
Output: ["ad", "ae", "af", "bd", "be", "bf", "cd", "ce", "cf"].
Note:
Although the above answer is in lexicographical order, your answer could be in any order you want.

Q018(Medium): 4Sum
Given an array S of n integers, are there elements a, b, c, and d in S such that a + b + c + d = target? 
Find all unique quadruplets in the array which gives the sum of target.
Note: The solution set must not contain duplicate quadruplets.
For example, given array S = [1, 0, -1, 0, -2, 2], and target = 0.
A solution set is:
[
  [-1,  0, 0, 1],
  [-2, -1, 1, 2],
  [-2,  0, 0, 2]
]
